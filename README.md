# Advent of code 2024

My solutions for the [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

There is one file `day<X>.rs` per day, with three functions :

- `parse` : Parses the problem input into a structure of type `InputType`
- `solve_part_one`
- `solve_part_two`

Note that the code is public only to participate in the [Advent of code performance challenge](https://codspeed.io/advent), and source is not commented.
